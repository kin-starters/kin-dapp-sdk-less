# Kin SDK-less DApp Demo

The Kin SDK-less DApp Demo is a lightweight starter app based on the [Solana DApp Scaffold](https://github.com/solana-labs/dapp-scaffold) that will get you up and running with [SDK-less Kin](https://developer.kin.org/tutorials/SDK-less/) as quickly as possible.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

The responsive version for wallets and wallet adapter may not function or work as expected for mobile based on plugin and wallet compatibility. For more code examples and implementations please visit the [Solana Cookbook](https://solanacookbook.com/).

## Installation

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

## Build and Run

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## Features

```
1) Easily connect to wallets such as Phantom, Solflare, etc
2) Airdrop Solana and Kin to your connected wallet.
3) Send Kin to an account and be credited for the KRE with your App Index.
```
